Given a CSV file containing ETF data with attributes such as style, symbol, long name, risk score, and a composite score, design a portfolio based on the following criteria:

S&P Definition: Includes "S&P" in the long name.
Portfolio Categories:
S&P + Consistent Growth: 40% of ETFs in this category.
S&P + Aggressive Growth: 20% of ETFs in this category.

Non S&P + Aggressive Growth: 10% of ETFs in this category.
Investment Distribution: Distribute $15,000 across the ETFs based on their category weightages.

Allocate Portfolio: Based on the ETF rankings and the specified portfolio weightings, allocate ETFs to each category proportionally.
Calculate Investment Amounts: Distribute the total investment amount ($15,000) across the selected ETFs according to their weight in the portfolio.
